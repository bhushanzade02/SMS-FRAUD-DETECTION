## 🚀 Overview

**SMS Fraud Detection App** is a machine learning-powered web application that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam**. This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and traditional machine learning models to identify fraudulent messages and protect users from potential scams.

Built using:
- 🐍 Python
- 📦 scikit-learn
- 📊 TF-IDF Vectorization
- 🌐 Streamlit (for frontend deployment)

## 🌟 Features

- 💡 Clean and user-friendly interface
- ✂️ Smart text preprocessing using regex, stopword removal, and stemming
- 🧠 Machine learning model trained on a labeled SMS dataset
- ⚡ Real-time spam classification
- 📈 Lightweight and fast – suitable for personal or demo use

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Input**: Enter any SMS message in the text box.
2. **Preprocessing**: The message is cleaned, tokenized, and stemmed.
3. **Vectorization**: Text is converted into numerical features using a trained TF-IDF vectorizer.
4. **Prediction**: The trained model classifies the message as "Spam" or "Not Spam".
5. **Result**: The app displays the result in an interactive format.
